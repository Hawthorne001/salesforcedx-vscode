## Overview

Use AI-based autocomplete to accept suggestions for repetitive, boilerplate code right in your editor.

## Set Up Inline Autocomplete

To use inline autocomplete, first activate the feature:

1. Select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (Windows or Linux) or **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (macOS).
2. Under **Einstein for Developers**, select **Enable Einstein Auto Completions**.

## Receive your First Inline Completions

Einstein for Developers autogenerates inline code completions suggestions. To start receiving inline completions:

1. In Visual Studio Code, create a new Apex class (\*.cls) file, or open an existing one.

2. In the Apex file, place your cursor inside a method. Einstein for Developers automatically suggests an entire method body in grayed text, as shown below. The exact suggestion may vary.

To accept the entire suggestion, press Tab. If you have VS Code's **Inline Suggest** enabled, you can accept the next word of the suggestion using one of the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Operating System | Accept Next Word |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| macOS            | ⌘→               |
| Windows          | ⌥→               |
| Linux            | ⌥→               |

Note: If you don't see a suggestion, make sure Einstein Auto Completions are enabled.

**_Note_**: Use the Option (⌥)\ hotkeys to manually generate autocomplete suggestions if you don't have the auto completions setting enabled.
